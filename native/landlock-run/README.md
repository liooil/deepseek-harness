English | [中文](README.zh.md)

A [Landlock](https://landlock.io/) self-restrict-then-exec launcher for confining subprocesses on Linux. The harness keeps its thin JS entry package and per-platform binaries as private workspace packages; they are build inputs for the client runtime, not an npm distribution channel.

The tool is **`landlock-run`** — a self-restrict-then-exec [Landlock](https://landlock.io/) launcher (~300 lines of C11 over the raw kernel UAPI, statically linked against musl). It installs a Landlock ruleset on itself and `exec`s the wrapped command; the ruleset is inherited across `execve`, so the command and every process it spawns run confined while the invoking process stays unrestricted. Fail-closed: if the kernel cannot enforce, it exits without running the command.

## Workspace use

The repository keeps one entry package plus platform optional packages:

```text
@deepseek-ai/node-addon-landlock-run
@deepseek-ai/node-addon-landlock-run-linux-x64
@deepseek-ai/node-addon-landlock-run-linux-arm64
```

The `os`/`cpu` fields select the matching platform package when the workspace is installed for development or internal tests. There is no install-time build fallback on purpose: on a host without a platform package the resolved path never exists, the probe reports `unusable`, and the consumer falls closed.

## Usage

```js
import { grantArgs, launcherPath, probe } from '@deepseek-ai/node-addon-landlock-run';

const launcher = launcherPath();
if (probe(launcher) !== 'unusable') {
  const argv = [launcher, ...grantArgs({ readOnly: ['/'], readWrite: ['/tmp/work'] }), '--', 'bash', '-c', command];
  // spawn argv with your process runner of choice
}
```

The public API is intentionally small:

- `launcherPath()`: absolute path of this host's launcher (existence deliberately unchecked — the probe is the availability signal).
- `probe(launcher?, { timeoutMs? })`: functional enforcement probe — `'full' | 'partial' | 'unusable'`.
- `grantArgs({ readOnly?, readWrite? })`: the launcher's grant argv; everything not granted is denied.
- `LAUNCHER_BIN` and `LAUNCHER_FAILURE_EXIT` (125): contract constants. A successfully exec'd child may also return 125, so consumers need the fatal diagnostic as well as the status to attribute launcher failure.

The full binary contract (argv grammar, exit codes, report lines) is pinned in [docs/cli-contract.md](docs/cli-contract.md).

## Support

linux-x64 and linux-arm64, kernel with Landlock enabled (5.13+; ABI level determines `full` vs `partial` enforcement — see [docs/support-matrix.md](docs/support-matrix.md)). Other platforms deliberately have no package: consumers run different confinement backends there.

## Development

```sh
corepack enable
pnpm install
pnpm build:ts        # entry packages → lib/
pnpm build:native    # this Linux architecture's binaries (apt-get install musl-tools)
pnpm test
```

Binaries are git-ignored and built natively per architecture — locally for your own machine, by CI's per-arch runners as the builders of record. The desktop executable is the only public release artifact.
